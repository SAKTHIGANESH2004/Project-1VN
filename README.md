# Project-1VN
This project explores forecasting high-frequency time-series data using HAR-ARIMA, SARIMA, and XGBoost. It analyzes intraday, weekly, and seasonal patterns, compares accuracy across models, and shows how hierarchical lags and feature engineering improve predictions. XGBoost achieved the best overall performance.
