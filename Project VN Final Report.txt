Final Project Report – Advanced Time Series Forecasting (HAR-ARIMA)

This project aimed to build, justify, and compare multiple forecasting models—SARIMA, 
HAR-ARIMA, and XGBoost—using a multi-scale time-series dataset showing clear daily,
weekly, and yearly patterns.
All assigned tasks were successfully completed, and a full comparative evaluation was performed.

1️.Dataset Acquisition & Preparation

Loaded a high-frequency time-series dataset with clear seasonality.

Performed cleaning, handling missing timestamps, and resampling.

Documented preprocessing steps clearly for reproducibility.

2️ HAR-ARIMA Model Implementation

Implemented ARIMA structure with three hierarchical time scales:

Short-term (θ1), Medium-term (θ2), Long-term (θ3).

Justified AR and hierarchical lag selections based on ACF/PACF patterns.

Ensured the model can capture multi-scale temporal dependencies.

3️⃣Model Training & Hyperparameter Tuning

Tuned HAR-ARIMA parameters to reduce error significantly.

Built a baseline SARIMA with seasonal order selection.

Engineered lag/rolling features for XGBoost, improving non-linear pattern detection.

4️.Final Comparative Evaluation

Computed MAE, RMSE, MAPE% for all three models.

Prepared a clear comparison table and interpreted results.

Identified the most accurate model and explained performance differences.

Conclusion:


1.The project successfully demonstrates that multi-scale modeling greatly improves forecast accuracy.

2.HAR-ARIMA significantly outperformed SARIMA by capturing long-range dependencies.

3.XGBoost delivered the best overall accuracy, thanks to feature-engineering and its ability to model nonlinear patterns.
